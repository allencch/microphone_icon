# Microhpone Icon

Web camera has an indicator if it is capturing.
But we do not know whether any application is using microphone to capture the audio.
I usually mute the microphone, only unmute during meeting.
To make it easy to turn on/off, I create this program, inspired by `volumeicon`.

It requires ALSA and PulseAudio, build on GTK3.
